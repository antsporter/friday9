Friday 9th task

How I expected the challenge to go.

I thought it would go ok as the logic makes sense to me, I wanted to complete the stretch task also which i knew would be harder for me.


What went well?

I got it sorted out which made me feel confident going into the stretch goals.


What didn't go as planned?

The length of time it took it to organise the CSS and make it look viewable.


Possible improvements for future challenges

Don't worry about the stretch goals and get the MVP sorted before overthinking it.
